# One Art by Elizabeth Bishop
- Quite direct narrative
- Considering the art of losing as a Singular Art
- Losing bondages becomes a defense mechanism in a mosaic society
- Losing memories becomes an act of survival in a parallex prism
- Losing material connections becomes a necessity in a bonded economy
- Losing becomes an ephemeral act of freedom in a hierarchal social network
- Losing experience begins as a subjective experience
- Losing experience evolves into an objective occurance in the eventuality
